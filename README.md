heltouch-web
===================

Minimal websocket application copied from Miguel Grinbergs [Flask-SocketIO-Chat](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/Flask-SocketIO-Chat)

To run this application install the requirements in a virtual environment, run `python heltouch.py` and visit `http://localhost:5000` on one or more browser tabs.

If you prefer, you can also start the server using the Flask cli:

    $ FLASK_APP=heltouch.py flask run
